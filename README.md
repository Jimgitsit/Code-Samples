# Code-Samples
Sample code from recent projects.

### Norther Arizona Healthcare
> 2015-2016 - A Built from scratch service that consolidates and normalizes data from different sources and exposes that data via an REST API. It includes a scheduled service that automatically imports and updates data daily, an administration UI to manipulate and analyze the data, and an API to expose the data from a common endpoint. One component of the API that I'm particularly proud of that far exceeded client expectations is a custom built, re-usable weighted search engine, capable of keyword overrides and analytics to fine tune and optimize search results.

### AlaCarte
> 2015 - This is a highly specialized CMS written as a browser plug-in (javascript) with a PHP/MySQL back-end for AAA Automotive. It provides a wysiwyg interface used by site administrators to custom tailor content based on a variety of triggers such as sub-domain, location, age, membership level, etc. It is currently used by regional AAA sites all over the country.

### Instafluence
> 2013-2014 - A data intensive web application for bringing together popular social personalties (influencers) with brands for organic advertising. It consists of a registration area where users can submit applications to be considered for campaigns, a suite API wrappers for many of the most popular social networks (Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, etc) that regularly imports various data (uses MongoDB) about users and their following for analytical purposes, and a research tool for finding the right influencer to match with brands. Instafluence was bought by Disney in 2015 and is in the process of being re-branded but still uses all the software that I built.

### Virtualrain
> 2012-2013 - A SASS used by vendors of Virtualrain Inc (a national supplier of landscaping products) to deliver products and information to their retail customers. It consists of global and vendor admin portals whiten in PHP using a MySQL database, a mobile-first centric web site for end-users, and custom branded Android and iOS apps for each vendor. It allows vendors to custom tailer their product line and automate and simplify order processing and messaging with their clients.
