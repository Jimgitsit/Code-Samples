	<h2>Instafluence Privacy Policy</h2>

	<br/>
	<h3>Effective December 1, 2012</h3>

	<br/>
	<p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) covers Instafluence, LLC (“Instafluence”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and describes the types of information we gather from people visiting www.Instafluence.com or using the Instafluence mobile application (the “App”), and how we use such information. We understand the importance of privacy and accordingly, treat all information received in a responsible manner. By downloading or accessing the App, you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the App or our services. Each time you use the App or services, the current version of the Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, when you use the App or Services, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top) and review any changes since the last version.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3>Types Of Information We Collect</h3>
	
	<p>Instafluence may collect two types of information from users of our App: “personal information” which is information that can be used to locate you, contact you, or determine your specific identity (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, etc.) and “aggregate information” which is information about your activities on the App or in connection with the services that cannot be used to identify, locate, or contact you (such as frequency of visits to the App, data entered when using the App, App pages most frequently accessed, browser type, etc.).</p>

	<br/>
	<h3>Collecting Your Personal Information</h3>
	
	<p>Instafluence collects personal information that:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>you provide when you sign up for a Instafluence account and/or downloads the App</li>
		<li>you allow us to collect from your use of certain features</li>
		<li>you post content through the App</li>
		<li>you allow us to collect from other social media services</li>
		<li>we get from seeing you use the Instafluence App</li>
		<li>we get from communicating directly with you</li>
		<li>we get from cookies and other technology</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Specifically, when you sign up for an account, we ask you for your name, email address, and business information, among other information. We also watch how you interact with the App whether by posting photo collages or by commenting or interacting with others collages. Because the App is built on a mobile device platform, we may also have access to other information such as the location(s) where you use the App if you choose to share that information with us.</p>

	<br/>
	<h3>Collecting Your Aggregate Information</h3>
	
	<p>Aggregate information is collected as you visit our App or interact with our services even if you do not enter any information. Generally, aggregate information is used in a collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled information. Instafluence uses aggregate information to provide its services and remuneration, as well as to determine the use of our App and to monitor, audit and analyze information pertaining to our business metrics. </p>

	<br/>
	<h3>Using, Sharing, Selling and Trading of Your Personal Information with Third Parties</h3>
	
	<p>We use the information that we gather from or about you to provide the App to you, to improve the features and functionality of the App and services provided by Instafluence, to communicate with you about any questions or requests you submit to Instafluence, and to provide relevant marketing and other information to you. In some instances we may be obligated by law to share certain of your information with legal authorities.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Instafluence on occasion, may share personal information with third party service providers as we deem necessary for the third party to fulfill their duties, such as fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. These third party service providers are not authorized to retain, share, store or use your personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services for which they have been hired to provide. When you submit your personal information, you also agree that we may use your personal information to contact you by email, telephone, cell phone, direct mail, or text message about certain offers made available by us or third parties that we believe you might be interested in based on information you have provided to us. We do not sell, trade or otherwise share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing purposes, however, we may market certain offers to you on behalf of third parties we determine that you might be interested in.  Sharing, Selling and Trading Aggregate Information Collected Online with Third Parties We may use aggregate information to improve the App and services, to monitor traffic and general usage patterns, and for other general business purposes. We may disclose aggregate information to third parties for a variety of business reasons, including to advertisers to inform them of the usage habits or characteristics of the interested audience, and to potential investors so that they may better understand our user base, etc. Aggregate information will not include any personal information and we will not disclose any personal information except as expressly stated elsewhere in this Policy.</p>

	<br/>
	<h3>Other Instances When We Share Your Information</h3>
	
	<p>In addition to the foregoing, Instafluence may elect to share or transfer your personal information to unrelated third parties: (i) to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Instafluence, (ii) to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) in connection with the sale, purchase, merger, reorganization, liquidation or dissolution of Instafluence; (iv) when we believe it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of Instafluence or other persons, or (v) as otherwise required or permitted by law. </p>
	<br/>
	<p>It should be noted that on some portions of the App, users can choose to have their personal information displayed. If users choose to have their personal information displayed on the App, they will be given forewarning that the action they are about to take will make their personal information publicly available on the App. </p>

	<br/>
	<h3>Public Sharing of Your Content</h3>
	
	<p>Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as user content, becomes available to the public, as controlled by any applicable privacy settings that you set. To change your privacy settings on the Service, please change your profile setting. Once you have shared user content or made it public, that user content may be re-shared by others. Subject to your profile and privacy settings, any user content that you make public is searchable by other Users and subject to use under our Terms and Conditions. If you remove information that you posted to the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users or third parties have copied or saved that information.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3>Cookies or Similar Technologies; Device Identifiers</h3>
	
	<p class="underline">If you do not provide us any of your personal information, we are limited in the information we may collect from you. For example, we may be able to determine your IP address for the purposes of administering the App and tracking App usage. However, your IP address may vary each time you visit or it may remain the same depending on the type of Internet connection you are using or the location from which you access the App. We aggregate information to help us to compile reports as to trends and other behavior about users of our App; however such information is generally anonymous and not tied directly to you.</p>
	<br/>
	<p class="underline">We may also use “cookies” or similar technologies such as pixels, and beacons and your personal information to enhance your experience on the App and with the Services and to provide you with personalized offers. A cookie is a small data file placed on your computer’s hard drive that contains information that allows us to track your activity on the App. The cookie itself does not contain any personal information; however, if you provide us any personal information the cookie may act as an identifier to tie your personal information to your IP address or computer. You may choose to delete cookies from your computer’s hard drive at anytime or to disable cookies on your computer. If you delete cookies that relate to the App, we may not be able to identify you upon your return to the App. Additionally, if you disable your computer’s cookies, you may not be able to access certain features of the App or services that require that cookies be enabled. The App’s cookies cannot be used to read data from your hard drive and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other websites. Additionally, our cookies cannot be used as a virus, Trojan horse, worm, or any other malicious tool that could impair your use of your computer. Our cookies are used to help us better understand how you and other users use the App so we can continue to provide a better, more personalized user experience on the App. We also share App usage information about our App with those interested in running targeted promotional campaigns on the App. For this purpose, we and our advertisers track some of the pages that you visit on the App through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs).</p>
	<br/>
	<p>When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Service, we may access, collect, monitor, store on your device, and/or remotely store one or more "device identifiers." Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Instafluence. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third party partner about how you browse and use the Service and may help us or others provide reports or personalized content and ads. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</p>
	
	<br/>
	<h3>Security Pertaining to Your Information</h3>
	
	<p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Instafluence employees, service providers and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. We use secure socket layer (“SSL”) technology to encrypt and protect the security of your personal information, including but not limited to your credit card number, when it is sent over the Internet. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Instafluence, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you connect to Instafluence make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other organization.  Integrity of Your Data Instafluence processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Policy. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.  Children and Privacy Our App is not directed to children and we will not request personally identifiable information from anyone who we know to be under the age of 18, unless we have obtained verifiable parental consent from a parent or legal guardian. If we become aware that a user under the age of 13 has registered with our App, provided personal information, and Instafluence has not obtained prior verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian, we will immediately remove the user’s personal information from our files.  External Links The App may contain links to third party websites operated by other people or companies. Those websites may have their own privacy policy or no privacy policy at all. Instafluence does not have any responsibility for those websites, and we provide the links solely for the convenience of our visitors.  Business Transfers In the event that Instafluence sells substantially all of its assets, or one of Instafluence’s business units is acquired, personal information of visitors to the App and aggregate information will likely be one of the transferred assets.  Changes to this Policy We may change this Privacy Policy at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Policy on our App. Your continued use of the App and/or services indicates your consent to our collection of and use of your personal and aggregate information under the then current Policy.  Corrections/Information Removal/Opt-Out If your name, e-mail or postal address, telephone number or other personal information changes, you may update, correct or omit the relevant information by contacting Instafluence Customer Service at support@Instafluence.com.
